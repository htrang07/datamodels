This is a link to the database called [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/). The basic option of Mongo is an open-source database. The data model is No-SQL. The hosting models are client/server and cloud-based hosting. To access using Java, download the driver from the MongoDB website. Add the driver in the Java application's classpath. Once the driver is installed, create a MongoClient object to connect to the database.
